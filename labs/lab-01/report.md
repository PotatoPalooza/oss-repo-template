## 2. Reading assignments - make sure to reflect on these in your lab report 
### Two additional suggestions on how to answer questions in a helpful way:

#### Avoid linking external resources as part of your answer without any context.
Often answers to challaning technical problems require background on the topic that can be hard to summurize quickly and so linking external resources can be helpful. However, it should be assumed that eventually these links will fail eventually and so with each link there should be included a breif summary of what the link contained so a user can find that information even if the link is broken. Many times I have found answers to questions that rely heavily on linked disussions or background where the links have failed rendering the answer hard to understand and useless.

#### Summarize the source of the confusion/question in your answer. (Restate the problem)
On discussion forums many questions start in a relativly simple place but evolve into more complex questions with many sub parts. It is important when answering questions in these long public forums to specifically address the question you are answering and summerize the problem up until that point. This will ensure that your answer can be understood without the context of reading the entire discussion, making it easier for people with similar questions to find and learn from.
