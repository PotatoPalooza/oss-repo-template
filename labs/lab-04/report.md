# Lab 4
1. Give a Creative Commons license to your lab report in your lab folder.
  * See below
2. Read the four criteria for Free Software
3. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
 * It is important to choose a license because it clarifies the permissions an owner is granting over their project including other people's ability to use, redistribute, and modify thier code. A license provides explicit terms for the use of the software and without it no one has permission to use the code for their own purposes, nullifying the open source nature of a project. A project without a license could adopt a harsh restrictive license at any time and take all contributor work with it as well as restrict use after the project is being used elsewhere. On top of this, having a license can protect the owner from liability with regards to the use of thier software. Choosing a license is the step that officially permits the world to use and benefit from a project's code.
5. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
* Projects without explicit licenses should be avoided because at any time the project owner could choose to make their license more restrictive and jeporadise the work you put into that project aswell as anything that relies on that project directly or indirectly. A project without a license is automatically assumed to be under exclusive copyright and no one can copy distribute or modifiy the work without being in some form of legal work. This is why a licencse is an essential part of making a project free and opensource.
6. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?
7. Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?
8. As a table (group of 3-5 students), make up an open source project and a business model that you could use to make money from it.
9. Take 5 projects from past RCOS Projects and create a table for which project has which license. for example:
