## Part 2: In Depth Analysis of NumPy

NumPy is an easy to use numerical computing library for python that offers high speed performance with an extensive feature set. NumPY was founded by data scientist [Travis Oliphant in 2005](https://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/History_of_SciPy) who wanted to bring unity into the python based scientific computing community and the project quickly grew to be included in millions of projects around the world largely thanks to Oliphant's dedication to open sourcing the project. NumPy allows users to easily manipulate high dimensional data, compute various linear algebra operations, perform essential data science operations, sort data, and more. Soon an entire charity named [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/project/numpy) was built to financially support fully open source projects like NumPY and the library's mass adoption even made it a candidate to be included into the base version of python, however this never materialized. 

NumPy has always been and will continue to be a free and open source project. Currently NumPy is licensed under a BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License which permits commercial use, modification, private use, and distribution which is why it is recognized as a [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses) license. It is for this reason that NumPy receives a full 2 on the Licensing score in the table above. 

The codebase of NumPy, despite being a python package, is actually around only 62.4% python a large secondary portion of 35.2% being written in C. This is because the underlying speed optimizations of NumPy rely on making high level calls in python to low level compiled C code which can fully exploit the resources of a machine and avoid Python's notoriously slow interpreter. Various [online articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-fast-numpy-really-is-e9111df44347) and tests reveal the same story; that for many mathematical operations NumPy arrays are much faster (sometimes 5-10X) then their python equivalents. Speed an ease of use has made NumPy a favorite among researchers and engineers who like to prototype rapidly with as little development overhead as possible. In this way, NumPy is seen as a programming langue in its own right with it's own conventions and syntax that has slowly permeated into other python libraries like [opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv). Since NumPy not only utilizes the most popular programming languages of the day, but also extends both C's and Python's usability and audience it easily scores a perfect 2 in the language category. Contributing to NumPy's codebase would ensure your code is used by millions of machines and including NumPy in your python project effortlessly through pip can introduce huge performance and simplicity gains.

This infamous reputation combined with the open source repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) has enabled a massive community to form around the project. NumPy scores a 2 in the level of activity with it's year round activity and >10 commits every single week. To contribute to this open community NumPy has an extremely well organized development process that simplifies the contribution process for a project this large. In just the month of June 2022 the repository has amassed 40 commits among 12 different authors with a dozen new issues, a dozen closed issues, and 21 merged pull requests ([here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulse)). A project of this activity is perfect for new and experienced developers to contribute as the changes are small enough for one person to keep up with (unlike some of the larger open source projects) but the weekly commits with a decent sized team means that individual contributions or issues are addressed swiftly. Due to this NumPy has amassed a large collection of over 1,130 contributors. 

NumPY also receives a perfect 2 for it's number of contributors because on top of having over 1,130 contributors in the past year, 50 of those contributors have committed more then 50 times in that time. Of the active contributors many consistently contribute [throughout the year](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/graphs/contributors) partially thanks to NumPy's active development team sponsored by the NumFocus non-profit charity. Looking at the top contributors as-well reveals that there are few drastic contribution spikes that can be observed in many smaller projects and that the biggest contributors are consistently active. This is great news as it indicates large updates to the codebase will always have active members to explain the changes and a strong sense of leadership and direction can be preserved in the project. This may explain the relatively low commit rate to main as the development cycle although open to the public is highly controlled in the last step to ensure the quality and consistence of the NumPy project that many have come to depend on. 

However, powerful development teams and strong documentation cannot overcome all challenges. At the end of the day NumPy is still a massive project with over 277.5k lines of code and a repo size of 108.41 MB which inherently makes it difficult for new time developers or developers looking to contribute in a small way. Even though there are larger open source projects out there like Android and Chromium, NumPy deals with lots of complex low level optimization in hardware specific C code as well as the difficult challenge of creating simplified abstractions to massively flexible mathematical functions. This is where the size of a highly technical project can become a burden to new developers as among the 2K open issues many of them are bugs with new and long term features that has led to a conservative approach to adding new features with high standards that may be challenging for inexperienced developers to abide by. Much of the NumPy codebase is littered with links to complex math concepts, rare syntactical tricks, and complex code structure for individual functions that increases the conceptual burden or "mental size" of the project. For this reason NumPy receives a score of 1 in the product size.

From some of NumPy's largest issues arise its greatest assets. That is NumPy's Issue tracker! NumPY has dealt with non stop bugs since it's inception, pushing python and C to it's limits to offer new features. Out of this has arisen the most well organized bug trackers out of all the projects above. This has allowed the NumPy team to actively work on over 1,990 open issues as well as close an impressive 8,689 issues in it's history. Every bug is neatly labeled by number, type, and color coded to correspond to the type of issue. On top of this, each issue is full of example code, reproducible issues, and productive discussion that makes sorting through the current state of NumPy trivial. The only thing NumPy's issue tracker is lacking is label for good first issues likely due to the project's feature and bug complexity. In my evaluation this bug tracker scores a full 2 for it's extensive use and well organized structure.

Despite NumPy's complexity, the project stays true to it's long open source history, welcoming new contributors with open arms. Right in the .github folder of the main repository, NumPy extensively links to it's website for a large and complete contribution guide. The full documentation can be found [here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/) and includes standards, best practices, and even individual bash commands to adhere to the NumPy's contribution standards. Despite being a large and old project, NumPy is surprisingly friendly in this regard. NumPy goes above and beyond in their communication structure, providing open links to join their Slack channels, Github discussions, developer mailing lists, and email groups. All of these communication channels are active, allowing new contributors to easily plug into the existing culture and productivity scheme and begin adding value as soon as possible. NumPy comes with a 34 page wiki and various developer templates to answer all and any questions about early development.
