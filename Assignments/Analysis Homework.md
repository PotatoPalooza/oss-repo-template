Evaluation:
1. Licensing: Tensorflow scores a two for having a clearly stated Apache-2.0 license that is OSI approved.
2. Language: Tensorflow scores a two in it's languages for keeping the project in mostly C++ and Python, two of the most popular and best supported programming languages of the day.
3. Level of Activity: Tensorflow's level of activity is easily two as it consistently has hundreds of commits every week and thousands of open issues being worked on.
4. Number of Contributors: Tensorflow boasts an impressive 3,129 contributors many of which are google employees who work on the project full time leading to consistent and significant contributions.
5. Product Size: Tensorflow is a massive project with millions of lines of code, extensive low level optimization, and lots of high level math that could make this project very intimidating for all but the most experience developers.
6. Issue Tracker: Tensorflow actively uses their issue tracker with a long list of good first issues for new contributors and an organized labeling scheme to streamline the processing of issues.
7. New Contributor: New contributors are on boarded with a custom introduction page that describes in great detail how new contributors can get started. Getting started comes with extensive documentation, easy installation guides, troubleshooting, and accessible community forums. Tensorflow's community is full of helpful and experienced developers.
8. Community Norms: Tensorflow adopts google's code of conduct which promotes inclusivity and holds the team leaders responsible for managing their platforms which the Tensorflow team does well. Navigating the various public forms on Tensorflow's website and Issues tracker reveals only polite conversations, even in moments of disagreement.
9. User Base:  Tensorflow has a large and diverse user base that the Tensorflow team supports with ample installation and getting started instructions. Along with this there are hundreds of free online videos and websites dedicated to learning Tensorflow as the demand for machine learning powered applications only grows.

Evaluation:
1. Licensing: HyperNerf is another google project that is both free and open source with an OSI approved Apache-2.0 license.
2. Language: HyperNerf is written in Python and Jupyter Notebooks, a common choice for researches with both languages being free and open source increasing the accessibility to their codebase. 
3. Level of Activity: The activity in HyperNerf's repo is sparse (only active one quarter out of the year) and from only a select few contributors. This is common with other open source research projects as often researchers are not interested in long term development.
4. Number of Contributors: Only three contributors actively develop for HyperNeRF, likely the authors to the research paper this code is for. This could make onboarding and communication difficult as the project owners could be absent or unavailable on any given day.
5. Product Size: This project is small with only 13k lines of code with much of that being documentation. This small project size could make this a good candidate to be adopted into a larger project and relatively easy to walk through a majority of the codebase for any individual.
6. Issue Tracker: There are only 15 open issues with fewer closed. Little organization and discussion is present in the issue tracker indicating this project is at risk for abandonment and has many unaddressed concerns from their user base.
7. New Contributor: New contributors will be greeted with a contribution summary that is largely copied from google's templates for their open source projects. The guidelines are good and indicate the team is willing to accept new members and contributors, however, there seems to be limited communication channels with the owners and little was added to google's base guidelines to customize the development process for this specific project. Both of these are indicators of a difficult getting started period for new contributors.
8. Community Norms: Like the contribution guide, google adopts their standard code of conduct. The code of conduct is detailed, clearly linked, references inclusivity, and is supported by many larger open source projects as well as Google itself. Along with this all conversations between the contributors have been cordial over GitHub and the conversations in Issues are generally concise with no rude comments.
9. User Base:  The user base for this project is also small and mostly comprised of other researchers. The paper has 595 stars on github, however, this number can be misleading as often the number spikes after some conference discussing the research paper, only to maintain no active supporters or users of the software. Along with this there is no troubleshooting or usage guides despite the codebase being a new and technical product.

## Part 2: In Depth Analysis of NumPy

NumPy is an easy-to-use numerical computing library for python that offers high-speed performance with an extensive feature set. NumPy was founded by data scientist [Travis Oliphant in 2005](https://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/History_of_SciPy) who wanted to bring unity into the Python-based scientific computing community and the project quickly grew to be included in millions of projects around the world largely thanks to Oliphant's dedication to open-sourcing the project. NumPy allows users to easily manipulate high dimensional data, compute various linear algebra operations, perform essential data science operations, sort data, and more. Soon an entire charity named [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/project/numpy) was built to financially support fully open-source projects like NumPy and the library's mass adoption even made it a candidate to be included in the base version of python, however, this never materialized. 

NumPy has always been and will continue to be a free and open-source project. Currently, NumPy is licensed under a BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License which permits commercial use, modification, private use, and distribution which is why it is recognized as a [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses) license. It is for this reason that NumPy receives a full 2 on the Licensing score in the table above. 

The codebase of NumPy, despite being a python package, is actually around only 62.4% python a large secondary portion of 35.2% being written in C. This is because the underlying speed optimizations of NumPy rely on making high-level calls in python to low-level compiled C code which can fully exploit the resources of a machine and avoid Python's notoriously slow interpreter. Various [online articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-fast-numpy-really-is-e9111df44347) and tests reveal the same story; that for many mathematical operations NumPy arrays are much faster (sometimes 5-10X) than their python equivalents. Speed and ease of use have made NumPy a favorite among researchers and engineers who like to prototype rapidly with as little development overhead as possible. In this way, NumPy is seen as a programming langue in its own right with its own conventions and syntax that has slowly permeated into other python libraries like [opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv). Since NumPy not only utilizes the most popular programming languages of the day but also extends both C's and Python's usability for its audience it easily scores a perfect 2 in the Language category. Contributing to NumPy's codebase would ensure your code is used by millions of machines and including NumPy in your python project effortlessly through pip can introduce huge performance and simplicity gains.

This infamous reputation combined with the open-source repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) has enabled a massive community to form around the project. NumPy scores a 2 in the Level of Activity with its year-round activity and >10 commits every single week. To contribute to this open community NumPy has an extremely well-organized development process that simplifies the contribution process for a project this large. In just the last month (June 2022) the repository has amassed 40 commits among 12 different authors with a dozen new issues, a dozen closed issues, and 21 merged pull requests ([here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulse)). A project of this activity is perfect for new and experienced developers to contribute as the changes are small enough for one person to keep up with (unlike some of the larger open-source projects) but the weekly commits with a decent-sized team ensure that individual contributions or issues are addressed swiftly. Due to this NumPy has amassed a large collection of over 1,130 contributors. 

NumPy also receives a perfect 2 for its Number of Contributors because, on top of having over 1,130 contributors in the past year, 50 of those contributors have committed more than 50 times in that time. Of the active contributors, many consistently contribute [throughout the year](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/graphs/contributors) partially thanks to NumPy's active development team sponsored by the NumFocus non-profit charity. Looking at the top contributors as well reveals that there are few drastic contribution spikes (a pattern that can be observed in many smaller transient projects) and that the biggest contributors are consistently active. This is great news as it indicates large updates to the codebase will always have active members to explain the changes and a strong sense of leadership and direction can be preserved in the project. This may explain the relatively low commit rate to main as the development cycle although open to the public is highly controlled in the last step to ensure the quality and consistency of the NumPy project that many have come to depend on. 

However, powerful development teams and strong documentation cannot overcome all challenges. At the end of the day, NumPy is still a massive project with over 277.5k lines of code and a repo size of 108.41 MB which inherently makes it difficult for new-time developers or developers looking to contribute in a small way. Even though there are larger open-source projects out there like Android and Chromium, NumPy deals with lots of complex low-level optimization in hardware-specific C code as well as the difficult challenge of creating simplified abstractions to massively flexible mathematical functions. This is where the size of a highly technical project can become a burden to new developers as among the 2K open issues many of them are bugs with new and long-term features that have led to a conservative approach to adding new features with high standards that may be challenging for inexperienced developers to abide by. Much of the NumPy codebase is littered with links to complex math concepts, rare syntactical tricks, and complex code structures for individual functions that increase the conceptual burden or "mental size" of the project. For this reason, NumPy receives a score of 1 in the Product Size category.

From some of NumPy's largest issues arise its greatest assets. That is NumPy's Issue tracker! NumPy has dealt with non-stop bugs since its inception, pushing python and C to their limits to offer new features. Out of this has arisen the most well-organized bug trackers out of all the projects above. This has allowed the NumPy team to actively work on over 1,990 open issues as well as close an impressive 8,689 issues in its history. Every bug is neatly labeled by number, type, and color-coded to correspond to the type of issue. On top of this, each issue is full of example code, reproducible issues, and productive discussion that makes sorting through the current state of NumPy trivial. The only thing NumPy's issue tracker is lacking is a label for good first issues likely due to the project's feature and bug complexity. In my evaluation, this Issue Tracker scores a full 2 for its extensive use and well-organized structure.

Despite NumPy's complexity, the project stays true to its long open-source history, welcoming new contributors with open arms. Right in the .github folder of the main repository, NumPy extensively links to its website for a large and complete contribution guide. The full documentation can be found [here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/) and includes standards, best practices, and even individual bash commands to adhere to the NumPy's contribution standards. Despite being a large and old project, NumPy is surprisingly friendly in this regard. The NumPy team goes above and beyond in their communication structure, providing open links to join their Slack channels, Github discussions, developer mailing lists, and email groups. All of these communication channels are active, allowing new contributors to easily plug into the existing culture and productivity scheme and begin adding value as soon as possible. NumPy comes with a 34-page wiki and various developer templates to answer all and any questions about early development, easily giving it a 2 in its New Contributor score.

In addition to the technical support, NumPy ensures a welcoming environment for all of its contributors. Prominent on NumPy's website and linked in their GitHub repo is a comprehensive and up-to-date [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). This code of conduct covers the typical basis of respect and the use of considerate and thoughtful language to communicate as well as provides the names and contact information for NumPy's committee that actively upholds the code of conduct. A person to directly communicate with regarding violations of their code of conduct provides a sense of accountability and enforcement within the community to avoid toxic contributors. They go above and beyond with an included statement on diversity, stating "No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.", ensuring a warm welcome to people of any background. This can be seen when going through NumPy's extensive communication channels. Often communications are concise, polite, and never disrespectful even in disagreement. In the four conversations, I analyzed I saw no indication of impoliteness or violation of the code of conduct, and a quick search for commonly offensive terms within NumPy's repo and website reveals no results. The benefit of NumPy's professional non-profit sponsors is a visible transfer of culture and standards that are kept in line with the best and biggest open-source projects out there. For all of these, reasons NumPy earns a 2 in its Community Norms score. 

Overall, taking all of these outstanding aspects of the NumPy project and its development process, it's no surprise that NumPy has an absolutely massive user base. NumPy is easily installed with python's package manager Pip and on GitHub has amassed over 1.1 million users. Their codebase is watched by 562 people with 20.8k stars and over 7k forks. [One article](https://towardsdatascience.com/numpy-in-numbers-1d235138e177#:~:text=Geographical%20distribution%20of%20Numpy%20Downloads&text=US%20accounted%20for%2032M%20downloads,0.5M%20to%201M%20range.) even estimates NumPy's downloads in the US alone to be 32 million. Due to this massive demand for their product, the NumPy team has developed extremely detailed and accessible documentation with an entire repository dedicated to various tutorials on how to use NumPy properly. The [tutorial repository](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials) alone has over 300 commits and indicates the team's dedication to not only producing an amazing project but sharing it with the world for free. NumPy scores a 2 in this final category of User Base, bringing its total score to 17. NumPy sets a standard to strive for among open-source projects in its fantastic organization, welcoming environment, and consistent meaningful progress.
